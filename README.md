## The Beach Combers
_Your Beach Buddy_

_Going to the beach in the summer is an absolute must. Even if you only go once, I believe that having yourself a beach day at some point over the summer should be mandatory. What's not to love about it? You can get a little sun, enjoy the effects of salty ocean water in your hair, wear a cute straw hat, and take in the serenity of a relaxing day spent in the sand. Going with your friends always makes for a fun time, but having a solo beach day can is something we don’t like._



## Why being by the beach is best?

1. **Vitamin D** 
The ultraviolet rays increase the production of serotonin. This means that you feel more happy, sunny, energised and bright. Who wouldn’t want to feel even better if they could?

2. **Always feeling like you are on holiday**
When you go to beach in evening from a long day of activities you are greeted with a unique sunset every night. Not to mention you will be in the mist of the relaxing vibes from the local
community.

3. **Chance for bonding**
When one thinks of the beach, it almost always inspires happy memories of community and being surrounding by family, friends and possibly a significant other, having a barbeque and losing track of time. Not to mention, beach destinations are also regularly associated with honeymoons. Heading to Cottesloe beach could almost definitely conjure up some romantic memories (and hopefully not some terrible breakup memories).

4. **Not only feeling, good but looking good**
The fresh air, the swimming and especially walking along the beach help people to feel good and look great. Plus, it’s far more exciting than running on a treadmill for hours. The vitamin D and the salt water are great for keeping your hair clean and strong. The sea water is also wonderful for clearing up problem skin as it acts as a natural exfoliate.

5. **Relaxation all the way**
De-stress by mediating with the beautiful beach surrounding the waves can act as a smoothing back ground as you mediate under the warm sun or as you lie floating in the Ocean. Being by the beach brings so much tranquillity.

6. **Discovering**
The Cottesloe reef and the sea life that can only been found at the beach, in rock pools or as you walk along the beach provide you with unique and eye opening experiences. Every time you head to the beach you will discover something new.

7. **Amazing people watching**
People are carefree at the beach which can lead to some interesting sights but can always make for a friendly and welcoming environment. It’s always entertaining watching a seagull steal someone’s chips when they aren’t looking.

8. **It's Free!**
Free is always good (especially if you aren’t alone)


## What is the problem?
Having a beach day can be fun but if you go solo then it would be full of boredom too. Approx. 6 out of 10 people have no one to go with them on the beach, so they ended up going solo and feel depressed when they see other couples roaming around! Also there are less volunteering groups and individuals find it difficult to volunteer alone, and also clean-up drives are less seen nowadays. 


## What is the Solution, we are offering?
We developed a web app where you can find other people who are finding people to go on the beach and you can chat with them and can fix the time of your meet at you favorite Beach. So, that it will kill boredom of both of you and you can spend an amazing adventurous weekend!

**ALSO, OUR APP CONNECTS YOU TO:**
Various Communities/NGOs who are working for Beach cleaning drives & Beach safety Crews!

## How to find the perfect travel buddy?
